# Analysis of Water Classification using Machine Learning
This is a repository for one of the projects done during my Postgraduate studies in Advance Computer Science. This analysis was done by Olaitan Olakanmi.  <br />
Both the dataset and Jupyter notebook used for the project are included in this repository.  <br />
<br />
**Requirement** - Using scikit-learn (aka sklearn) library, implement a machine learning model of your choice to train your model on a dataset. Calculate and report the accuracy of your model using one or more suitable metrics.
## Introduction
### Water is Life <br />

Water is essential to life. It is part of human existence and daily activities. To be safe for drinking, the water must satisfied some criteria like being tasteless, odourless and colourless. But with recent events and human activities, the criteria above can no longer satisfy how safe water can be for drinking or use as it comes polluted. Impurities like ammonia, bacteria, copper, viruses, mercury, lead and a host of other are not visible to the bare eyes.
But with laboratory testing, this can be detected if present in the water sample and based on acceptable values, the water can be determine if its fit for use or not and classification machine learning model can assist to classify into weather is safe or not safe  <br /><br />
## Methodology
### Python Libraries
For the classification project, the libraries used were:
* Scikit learn – For Machine learning algorithm
* Pandas – For data manipulation, analysis and storing.
* Numpy – For multi-dimensional array and matrices and also for high-level mathematical functions
* Seaborn & Matplotlib – For plotting graph and visualisation

### Project Flowchart
* The flow chart will entail the following;
* Data Cleaning
* Data Exploration
* Building the Model
* Evaluating the Model
* Testing the Accuracy of the Model

## Final Results
